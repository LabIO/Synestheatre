# Synestheatre
Depth Sonification research 
for sensory substitution devices 
for Synesthesia Lab at University of Sussex

Sonification of the image grabbed by a Kinect. Depth image is resized
 to a 13by7 grid. Therefore 91 samples are played, one for each pixel
 and their sound is controlled by Depth value and Color.
This prototype is being programmed upon request of 
Giles Hamilton-Fletcher of the University of Sussex.

Technical requirements
Samples should be encoded at 44100 samplerate
